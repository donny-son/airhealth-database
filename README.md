## Objective 

- Provide time serial geographic data for healthcare researchers

## Why

- New data sources(OpenAPI, Data Open Market, ...) for accuracy
- Different coordinate systems between data

## New data Sources

- Data Open Market
  - Actual traffic estimation rather than using road length and width

- OpenAPI
  - 

## Benefits

- Able to provide time serial geographic variables
- Accurate & faster calculation
- One stop access for various data from various sources

## Research Topics
- Short-term exposure
- `행정동`-wise or `법정동`-wise research

## Difficulties

- Projected coordinate system(EPSG:5179)
